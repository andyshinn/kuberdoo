# Kuberdoo

â€‹The Kuberdoo is a not-so-cheap x86-based take on a Raspberry Pi cluster. It is based on 6 [UDOO x86](https://www.udoo.org/udoo-x86/) boards housed in a custom acrylic case. Being x86 boards means we can treat them more like traditional physical servers.

## [Build](docs/build.md)

It's time to start the build once you have all the parts! This page will walk through configuration and construction of the Kuberdoo.
